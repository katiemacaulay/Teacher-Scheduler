# Teacher-Scheduler

My website will be a scheduler for one-subject area teachers ("Special Teachers") in Elementary Schools, and possibly for other teachers as well

Managing lots of classes (14-30) different classes a week can be daunting and hard to keep track of
This scheudler helps organize time for Art, Music, Theater Arts, and/or PE teachers
Teachers will be given a traditional school year calendar or year-around-calendar (Or I might preset calendars by school district)
They will be able to edit and store: no school days, pre-planned days off, and bad weather days.
Teachers will recieve alerts about their daily schedule to their preference of time and day (or at the beginning of week) to make planning easier

Scheudles can be shared accross all specials teachers, so that they know when potential collaborative times are open with each other and classroom teachers
A daily reminder can be sent to the classroom teachers as well so that they are aware of any potential changes in schedules

Gives an overview of an entire year for teachers to actually view without doing it manually (numebr of times a class will be seen in a year or in a grading period)

Long-term goal would be to be able to collect data of different schedule rotations for advocacy of one-subject area teachers to have adequete planning time and equal treatment as other teachers have.
